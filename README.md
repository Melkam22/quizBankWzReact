# quizBankWzReact

This is a react application with an inbuilt-server to store all questions. It shows list of randomly selected ten questions. The user starts playing the game by clicking on the correct answer among the four given responses and once we have responded to all ten questions, it will calculate and tell us our score. We can click on refresh and continue playing by generating another list of ten randomly selected questions.
